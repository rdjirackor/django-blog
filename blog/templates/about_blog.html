            Hi, you found it — welcome.<br><br>

            I began this blog because thoughts do not remain quietly in my mind and posting here allows me to catch them, wrestle them onto paper, and sometimes — occasionally — shape them into something worth reading.<br><br>

            Here are ideas that likely shouldn't work, but might. Here are the deep dives, the rants, the overthinking, and the random flashes of brilliance that occur at 2 AM when regular humans are dreaming.<br><br>

            This is a blog for the curious, a blog for the ones who think in "what ifs" and "why nots" instead of "maybes." It's uncurated, just me expressing anything I can think of and it's definitely not polished. It's not sanitized. It's alive. It's the inside of my brain with no filter.<br><br>

            So if you ever imagined that your brain is like a browser with 84 open tabs — and 7 of them are blasting music — then you'll probably feel right at home here.<br><br>

            Thanks for dropping by, I hope you stay and stay curious.
        </p>
